# STORY-IDEA-GENERATOR-VOC-S-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT-

# 🤖 Advanced Story Idea Generator

## 📌 Overview

This project is an *AI-inspired Story Idea Generator* created as part of my *AI & Prompt Engineering Internship*.
It helps writers, students, and creative thinkers generate *unique story prompts* by selecting a genre, theme, and characters — or by letting the AI surprise them.

Unlike a simple generator, this tool uses *prompt engineering techniques* to:

* Randomize templates for more creative outputs
* Provide a *“Surprise Me”* random mode
* Expand input into *narrative-driven prompts*
* Maintain a *history tab* of all generated ideas


## 🎯 Features

* 🎭 *Multiple Genres* → Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Romance, Horror, Thriller, Mystery, etc.
* 🎨 *Themes* → Love, Betrayal, Destiny, Survival, Friendship, Secrets, etc.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 *Custom Characters* → e.g., "Knight and Healer" or "Hacker and AI Assistant"
* ✨ *Dynamic AI-inspired Prompts* → Every click generates a new idea using randomized templates
* 🎲 *Surprise Me Mode* → Auto-generates a completely random story prompt
* 📜 *History Section* → Keeps track of all generated ideas
* 🖌 *Modern UI* → Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and responsive design


## 🛠 Tech Stack

* *HTML5* – Page structure
* *CSS3* – Styling with modern gradient UI
* *JavaScript (ES6)* – Core logic, randomness, and interactivity


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* 🌐 *Connect to OpenAI API* → Generate real AI-powered prompts
* 🧠 *Keyword Expansion* → Automatically enrich user input with related terms
* 📊 *Export Feature* → Save story prompts as PDF/Word
* 🎤 *Voice Mode* → Generate story prompts from speech input
